Visual Working Memory refers to the cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating visual information. It enables individuals to retain visual stimuli, such as shapes, colors, or spatial arrangements, over short periods while performing tasks or solving problems. This form of working memory is crucial for everyday activities, including navigating environments, recognizing faces, and interpreting visual scenes. Visual working memory is characterized by its limited capacity, often holding only a few visual items at once, and is governed by the interplay between perceptual encoding, maintenance, and retrieval processes. Studies have shown that visual working memory involves a network of brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex, which work together to maintain visual representations and support complex cognitive functions.
